  Application of Metamorphic Testing to Supervised Classifiers &
  MRs for classification algorithms:
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt, labelindent=0pt, itemindent=0pt]
    \item Consistency with affine transformation.
    \item Permutation of class labels.
    \item Permutation of attributes.
    \item Addition of uninformative/informative attributes.
    \item Consistency with re-prediction.
    \item Addition of training samples.
    \item Addition of classes by duplicating/re-labeling samples.
    \item Removal of classes/samples.
  \end{itemize}
  & Package: Weka
  Test Case: Randomly generated training and test data. The randomly generated data model does not encapsulate any domain knowledge.
  & Only a subset of MRs were a necessary property of the corresponding algorithm.  Several MRs violated NBC algorithms.  In the case of kNN algorithm, none of the necessary MRs were violated \\
