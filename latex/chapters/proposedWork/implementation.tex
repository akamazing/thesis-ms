\section{Selection of Implementations to Test}
Various models from TensorFlow is being used at different organizations like Mozilla, Google, Stanford University, etc. in different domains extending from speech recognition to computer vision. To evaluate the accuracy of some of the popular algorithms used in supervised classification we decided to implement metamorphic testing of:
\begin{itemize}
\item K-Nearest Neighbors
\item SVM
\item Neural Networks
\end{itemize}
