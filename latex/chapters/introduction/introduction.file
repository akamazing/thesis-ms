Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to implement and analyze. While developing and training an implementation of a machine learning model the aim is to create a model that makes the best predictions.
Lack of reliable oracles for testing machine learning algorithms makes it very hard to test such implementations. Such set of programs which does not have a test oracle that can predict the output on a set of inputs are called "non-testable programs"\cite{Murphy}.
